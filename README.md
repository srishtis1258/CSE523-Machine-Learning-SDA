Sleep and Physical Performance Analysis: A case study of Collegiate Womenâ€™s Basketball Players
Over the decade, there has been a considerable amount of research done in analyzing the impact of sleep and exercise on the performance and recovery of an athlete. The long term objective of this research is to make use of the Machine Learning paradigm to create a predictive model that would help a coach determine whether a player is fit to play in the forthcoming match on the basis of the underlying patterns and correlations between sleep, training load, cognitive state information of the athlete and their performance. In this term, the objective in this project duration is to perform necessary data imputations as a part of preprocessing of data.
